PowerSharp - Simple tools and themes for your Powershell Experience
============================================

Required
============
**Tested in Powershell 5.1**

For the powershell theme, it is recommended you install a nerdfont for everything to work,
and make sure you use that font in your terminal. [Nerd-Fonts](https://nerdfonts.com)
(Note: the custom terminal will likely look better with a non-monospaced font.)

It is recommended to have a nice terminal emulator for the best experience:

   - [Hyper](https://hyper.is)
   - [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
   - [Fluent-Terminal](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal)


Installation
============

In a "root" powershell terminal:

> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
