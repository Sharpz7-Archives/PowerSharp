PowerSharp - Simple tools and themes for your Powershell Experience
============================================

Required
============
**Tested in Powershell 5.1**

For the powershell theme, it is recommended you install a nerdfont for everything to work,
and make sure you use that font in your terminal. [Nerd-Fonts](https://nerdfonts.com)

It is recommended to have a nice terminal emulator for the best experience:

    - [Hyper](https://hyper.is)
    - [Cmder](https://cmder.net)

Installation
============

The easiest way to install the app is to use the `install.ps1` script.

__**Steps**__

Clone or download the repository.

> \$ git clone https://github.com/Sharpz7/PowerSharp.git

> \$ cd powersharp

Run the script with:

> \$ install.ps1

**PLEASE NOTE**

To use the `.env` files, copy the files and remove the `default` from the front of there names, then they
are good to go!
